# reticulate_ex (reticulate example)

### Objective ###
Introductory exercise in which R is used for data preprocessing, and Python is used in `reticulate` to train a Support Vector Machine for a simple classification task.

### Approach ###
Follow instructions in [R and Python: Using reticulate to get the best of both worlds](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/r-and-python-using-reticulate-to-get-the-best-of-both-worlds/). After running into a problem, reach out to the author, [Manuel Tilgner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manuel-tilgner-93616b101/?msgConversationId=6651730593560178688&msgOverlay=true), on LinkedIn for help.
